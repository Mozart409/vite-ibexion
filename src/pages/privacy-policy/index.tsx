          Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this

          purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a
          justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data
          processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally
          permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or
          commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion
          will take place after these reasons cease to apply.

          Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United
          States or other from a data protection perspective non-secure non-EU
          countries. If these tools are active, your personal data may
          potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be
          processed there. We must point out that in these countries, a data
          protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be
          guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to
          release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data
          subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in
          court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the
          Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your
          personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no control over these

        </p>
        <p>
          Google Remarketing analyzes your user patterns on our website (e.g.,
          clicks on specific products), to allocate a certain advertising target
          groups to you and to subsequently display matching online offers to
          you when you visit other online offers (remarketing or retargeting).
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it is possible to link the advertising target groups
          generated with Google Remarketing to device encompassing functions of
          Google. This makes it possible to display interest-based customized
          advertising messages, depending on your prior usage and browsing
          patterns on a device (e.g., cell phone) in a manner tailored to you as
          well as on any of your devices (e.g., tablet or PC).

        </p>
        <p>
          DoubleClick is used to show you interest-based ads across the Google

        </p>
        <p>

        </h3>
        <p>
          Our website embeds videos of the website YouTube. The website operator
          is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street,
          Dublin 4, Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to
          YouTube, this mode ensures that YouTube does not store any information
          about visitors to this website before they watch the video.
          Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that the sharing of data
          with YouTube partners can be ruled out as a result of the expanded
          data protection mode. For instance, regardless of whether you are
          watching a video, YouTube will always establish a connection with the
          Google DoubleClick network.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website, a
          connection to YouTube’s servers will be established. As a result, the
          YouTube server will be notified, which of our pages you have visited.
          If you are logged into your YouTube account while you visit our site,
          you enable YouTube to directly allocate your browsing patterns to your
          personal profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging out
          of your YouTube account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be
          able to place various cookies on your device or comparable
          technologies for recognition (e.g. device fingerprinting). In this way
          YouTube will be able to obtain information about this website’s
          visitors. Among other things, this information will be used to
          generate video statistics with the aim of improving the user
          friendliness of the site and to prevent attempts to commit fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions
          may be triggered after you have started to play a YouTube video, which
          are beyond our control.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online
          content in an appealing manner. Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, this is
          a legitimate interest. If a corresponding agreement has been
          requested, the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art.
          6(1)(a) GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time.

          servers in the United States, where it is archived. The operator of
          this website has no control over the data transfer. In case Google
          Maps has been activated, Google has the option to use Google web fonts

        <p>
          We use online conference tools, among other things, for communication
          with our customers. The tools we use are listed in detail below. If
          you communicate with us by video or audio conference using the
          Internet, your personal data will be collected and processed by the
          provider of the respective conference tool and by us. The conferencing
          tools collect all information that you provide/access to use the tools
          (email address and/or your phone number). Furthermore, the conference
          tools process the duration of the conference, start and end (time) of
          participation in the conference, number of participants and other
          “context information” related to the communication process (metadata).
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the provider of the tool processes all the technical data
          required for the processing of the online communication. This
          includes, in particular, IP addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs,
          device type, operating system type and version, client version, camera
          type, microphone or loudspeaker and the type of connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should content be exchanged, uploaded, or otherwise made available
          within the tool, it is also stored on the servers of the tool
          provider. Such content includes, but is not limited to, cloud
          recordings, chat/ instant messages, voicemail uploaded photos and
          videos, files, whiteboards, and other information shared while using
          the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that we do not have complete influence on the data
          processing procedures of the tools used. Our possibilities are largely
          determined by the corporate policy of the respective provider. Further
          information on data processing by the conference tools can be found in
          the data protection declarations of the tools used, and which we have
          listed below this text.

        <h4 id="purpose-and-legal-bases">Purpose and legal bases</h4>
        <p>
          The conference tools are used to communicate with prospective or
          existing contractual partners or to offer certain services to our
          customers (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR). Furthermore, the use of the tools
          serves to generally simplify and accelerate communication with us or
          our company (legitimate interest in the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
          Insofar as consent has been requested, the tools in question will be
          used on the basis of this consent; the consent may be revoked at any
          time with effect from that date.
        </p>
        <h4 id="duration-of-storage">Duration of storage</h4>
        <p>
          Data collected directly by us via the video and conference tools will
          be deleted from our systems immediately after you request us to delete
          it, revoke your consent to storage, or the reason for storing the data
          no longer applies. Stored cookies remain on your end device until you
          delete them. Mandatory legal retention periods remain unaffected.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have no influence on the duration of storage of your data that is
          stored by the operators of the conference tools for their own
