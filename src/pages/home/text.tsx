          IBEXION stands for high-end eBike components, with a focus on a
          state-of-the-art eBike Powertrain.
        </h6>

        <p>
          The aim is to be a reliable system partner in the areas of development
          and trade, providing the basis for optimum performance of contemporary
          eBikes.
          <br />
          IBEXION's team of experts has developed a convincing overall package
          in which intelligent energy management, durability and optimal
          fast-charging capability with high capacity are the driving forces.
          <br />
          The practical experience of thousands of kilometres led to the
          realisation: a bike tour is not over when the battery capacity is at
          zero and hours of charging are required: the battery capacity should
          only be over when your tour is over! Why wait for 180 minutes when you
          can do the job in 45 minutes? You are the engine! You have better
          things to do outdoors than wait four times as long.
